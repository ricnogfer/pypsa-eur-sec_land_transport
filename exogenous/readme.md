Description
-----------
The (Python) code stored in the present folder implements an exogenous-driven land transport (toy) model using [PyPSA](https://pypsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest). The main purpose of this implementation is to get familiar with PyPSA and energy system modelling in general. This familiarity will help enabling [PyPSA-Eur-Sec](https://pypsa-eur-sec.readthedocs.io/en/latest) with endogenous-driven land transport capabilities afterwards.


Dependencies
------------
The (Python) code stored in the present folder is known to work correctly with the following dependencies:

- Python 3.10.8

- PyPSA 0.21.3

- Pandas 1.5.3

- Gurobi 9.5.2
